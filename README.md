# Exoplanet-Survivor
Short game about exoplanets to accompany a lab for my astronomy class
You'll need the .gif in the same directory as the .py.

When you run the .py, it will take a moment to start.
Randomized parameters will be chosen for 4 exoplanet systems. One will be for a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of its star. For each system, a radial velocity curve and a light curve from a planet transit will be simulated. These calculations do not take into account limb darkening and they assume that all systems are perfectly edge on with only 1 planet in a circular orbit and the star is assumed to be on the main sequence.
On the page showing the plots, you must click the screen to make it the active window before you can do anything else. To view the plots for a given system more closely, you can push the letter associated with the system on your keyboard and a window will pop up displaying them. 
Given the plots and the stellar properties to the right, the user should be able to calculate the orbital period, the orbital radius, the planet mass, the planet radius, the average density of the planet, and the approximate habitable zone for the star.
Hitting enter will bring the user to a screen where they can choose which planet to go to and, just for added fun, which type of buildings they should bring (warm for the inner edge of the habitable zone, cold for the outer edge). 
If they chose the terrestrial planet in the habitable zone and the proper buildings, they will be successful. If they chose anything else, they will fail. In either case a story will be displayed along with the parameters they were supposed to have been able to calculate for their chosen system.
